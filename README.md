Implementation of a multi-layered neural network with perceptron learning for object classification

This was a class project for CS-3600 (Intro to Artificial Intelligence) at Georgia Tech. Using a small amount of template code, I implemented the necessary functions for training, testing, and improving the neural network. Relevant files include:
    1) neuralNet.py: The implementation of the neural network, including feed forward input processing and backpropagation learning
    2) testing.py: Code to run tests on training and accuracy of the network
    3) NeuralNet_Report.py: Data analysis on certain aspects of the network done for project submission
    4) Project 4.pdf: Detailed project description
